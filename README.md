A code example to access a URL, consume the JSON returned from the endpoint, and display it. 

This is all done mostly without using external libraries showing my knowledge of the whole android SDK.
Not using external libraries resulted in a debug APK size of 1.6MB

The only library used is Picasso to facilate showing images in the list


APK is available [here](https://github.com/steff2632/Symmetrical-Guacamole/blob/master/app-debug.apk?raw=true)

code from end of 2015
